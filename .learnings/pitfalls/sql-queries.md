# SQL Query Pitfalls

## Learnings

### COALESCE with Zero Default Creates False Positives in Comparison Queries
**Source**: BLD-5 — Phase 10: Workout Insights (PR Detection)
**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Context**: `getRecentPRs` used `COALESCE(subquery, 0)` to provide a default when no historical max existed for an exercise. Any weight > 0 then beat the default, making every first-ever exercise appear as a "personal record."
**Learning**: When a correlated subquery returns NULL (no prior data), `COALESCE(..., 0)` converts it to a value within the valid data range. A bare `>` comparison against NULL correctly evaluates to NULL/false, naturally excluding rows with no history. Two sibling functions (`getMaxWeightByExercise`, `getSessionPRs`) already handled this correctly — the inconsistency was caught only in code review.
**Action**: Never use COALESCE to supply a default for aggregate comparison queries — let SQL NULL propagation exclude no-data rows. When writing a set of related query functions, review all of them together for consistent NULL/edge-case handling.

### Validate Persisted Entity References Before Use
**Source**: BLD-7 — Workout Programs / Training Plans (Phase 11)
**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Context**: `activateProgram` preserved `current_day_id` from a prior session, but the referenced program day could have been deleted between deactivation and re-activation. `advanceProgram` used `findIndex` to locate the current day in the days array — if the day was deleted during a session, `idx === -1` caused incorrect wrap/cycle calculations.
**Learning**: Any stored reference (foreign key, pointer, cursor) to an entity in a table that supports deletion (hard or soft) can become stale. Operations that read and act on these references — reactivation, advancement, display — must verify the referenced entity still exists before proceeding. Without validation, stale references silently produce wrong behavior rather than explicit errors.
**Action**: Before using a persisted reference to act on related data: (1) query to confirm the referenced entity exists, (2) fall back to a safe default if it doesn't (e.g., first item in the list), and (3) for array-index lookups (`findIndex`), always handle the `-1` case explicitly with an early return. Add these checks during code review for any function that reads a stored ID and uses it to query or modify another table.

### Enforce Group Minimum-Membership Invariant at Every Deletion Path
**Source**: BLD-6 — Superset & Circuit Training Support (Phase 14)
**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Context**: Superset groups require ≥2 exercises. When an exercise is removed from a group, the remaining group may drop to 1 member, which is an invalid state. The invariant check ("if count < 2, dissolve group") had to be added in both `removeExerciseFromTemplate` (delete exercise entirely) AND `unlinkSingleExercise` (remove from group only).
**Learning**: When a feature introduces entity grouping with a minimum membership constraint, SQLite has no built-in trigger or CHECK constraint that can enforce "group must have ≥N members." The invariant must be enforced in application code at every function that can reduce group membership — not just the obvious "unlink" function, but also "delete entity," "bulk update," and any other removal path. Missing one path creates silently invalid 1-member groups.
**Action**: When implementing grouping features, list ALL functions that can remove a member from a group (delete, unlink, move, bulk-update). Add the minimum-membership check to each one. During code review, search for all writes to the grouping column (e.g., `link_id`) and verify each path includes the invariant check.

### Bounded Query Results Produce Wrong Aggregates When Re-Filtered Client-Side
**Source**: BLD-79, BLD-80 — Visual Polish & Home Stats Row Data Accuracy
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Context**: The home stats row derived "weekly workout count" by filtering `getRecentSessions(5)` results by the current week. `getRecentSessions(5)` returns at most 5 sessions regardless of timeframe, so the weekly filter over-counted (all 5 happened to be this week) or under-counted (sessions from earlier weeks consumed the 5-slot cap). The label said "this week" but the underlying data was "recent N."
**Learning**: A query bounded by row count (`LIMIT N`) returns an arbitrary time window. Client-side time-filtering of bounded results is silently incorrect when the bound is smaller than the filtered set. Similarly, labeling bounded data with a time-scoped label ("this week") is a semantic mismatch — the query scope and the display scope must agree.
**Action**: When displaying time-scoped statistics (e.g., "this week"), use a query explicitly bounded by that time window (e.g., `getWeekAdherence()`), not a count-bounded query re-filtered on the client. When a count-bounded query is the only available source, label the stat as "recent" not "this week." During review, check that every stat card's label matches its data source's actual scope.

### Map Custom User Data When Restructuring Category Enums
**Source**: BLD-30 — Strategic Pivot: Cable Machine + Voltra Exercise Database (Phase 22)
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Context**: The exercise category enum was restructured from 14 groups to 6 Voltra-specific groups (e.g., biceps+triceps → arms, legs+cardio → legs_glutes). Seed exercises were soft-deleted and re-seeded with correct categories, but user-created custom exercises still referenced the old category values.
**Learning**: Changing a category enum in the type system does not change the values already stored in the database. Custom user data (is_custom = 1) using old enum values must be explicitly migrated via UPDATE statements with category mapping. Seed data can be soft-deleted and re-inserted with new values, but user data must be preserved and remapped. Missing this step causes custom exercises to have invalid categories, breaking filters and UI grouping.
**Action**: When restructuring an enum stored as TEXT in SQLite: (1) define an explicit old-to-new mapping for every old value, (2) run UPDATE SET category = 'new' WHERE is_custom = 1 AND category IN ('old1', 'old2') for each mapping inside a transaction, (3) verify no rows remain with unmapped old values after migration, (4) only apply mapping to user data — seed data should be re-created with correct values.
