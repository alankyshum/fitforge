# Feature Plan: Workout Programs / Training Plans (Phase 11)

**Issue**: BLD-6
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Status**: APPROVED

## Problem Statement

FitForge supports individual workout templates — users create a workout (e.g., "Chest Day"), add exercises, and start a session. But there's no way to organize multiple workouts into a structured **training program** (e.g., Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, 5/3/1).

Users must manually remember which workout to do next and which day they're on in their split. Most commercial gym apps (Strong, JEFIT, Hevy) offer this feature behind a paywall. Making it free in FitForge is a strong differentiator.

## User Stories

- As a lifter following a PPL split, I want to create a program with Push/Pull/Legs days so the app tells me which workout is next
- As a user completing today's workout, I want the program to auto-advance to the next day so I don't have to track it manually
- As a returning user, I want to see "Next: Pull Day" on my home screen so I can start my workout with one tap

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

Add a **Programs** feature that lets users:
1. Create a named program with an ordered list of workout days
2. Each day links to an existing workout template
3. Track which day the user is currently on
4. Auto-advance to the next day after completing a workout
5. View program history and progress

### UX Design

**Tab Integration**: Add a segmented control at the top of the existing Workouts tab (no new tab — keep tabs at 5):

```
[Templates] [Programs]
```

**Segmented Control Default**: When the user opens the Workouts tab, show the **Programs** segment by default if an active program exists, otherwise default to **Templates**. This respects the user's primary intent — "do my next workout."

**"Next Workout" Banner Visibility**: The "Next Workout" banner appears on BOTH segments (Templates and Programs). The user's primary CTA should never disappear when switching segments.

**Program Creation Flow**:
1. Tap "New Program" FAB on Programs segment
2. Enter name + optional description
3. Add days by selecting from existing templates
4. Reorder days with up/down buttons (a11y-friendly)
5. Save program

**Active Program Flow**:
1. Only one program can be active at a time
2. When active, the Workouts tab shows "Next Workout: [Day Name]" banner at top
3. Tapping the banner starts a session from that day's template
4. After completing the session, auto-advance current_day (wrap to 0 at end)
5. Session is logged in program_log for tracking

**Program Detail Screen** (app/program/[id].tsx):
- Program name, description, number of days
- List of days with template names (if day label is empty, display the template name as fallback)
- "Set Active" / "Deactivate" button
- Progress indicator showing current day
- Cycle count (how many full cycles completed, derived from program_log)
- History section showing completed sessions

### Technical Approach

**Data Model** — Three new tables + one existing table modification:

**Design decisions from review:**
- No FOREIGN KEY declarations (consistent with existing codebase — `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is never enabled)
- Programs use soft-delete (`deleted_at` column), consistent with custom exercises
- `current_day_id` references a `program_days.id` (TEXT) instead of a position index — reorder-safe
- `workout_sessions` gets a new `program_day_id` column to link sessions to program days for reliable auto-advance
- `program_days.template_id` is nullable — when a template is hard-deleted, program days that reference it will show "Deleted Template" via NULL check
- Same template CAN appear in multiple program days (core PPL use case: Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Legs)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS programs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT DEFAULT '',
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  current_day_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  deleted_at INTEGER DEFAULT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS program_days (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  program_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  template_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  label TEXT DEFAULT ''
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS program_log (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  program_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  day_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  completed_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Migration: add program_day_id to existing workout_sessions table
ALTER TABLE workout_sessions ADD COLUMN program_day_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
```

**Migration notes:**
- The `ALTER TABLE` for `workout_sessions` must be wrapped in a try/catch — the column may already exist on subsequent app launches.
- Existing sessions will have `program_day_id = NULL` (started independently, not from a program).
- `current_day_id` references `program_days.id` — when a program is first activated with days, set to the first day's ID. When days are reordered, `current_day_id` stays stable (points to the same day regardless of position change).
- When a template is hard-deleted by `deleteTemplate()`, any `program_days` rows referencing it retain their ID but `template_id` should be set to NULL. Add an update step to `deleteTemplate()`: `UPDATE program_days SET template_id = NULL WHERE template_id = ?`.

**New Files**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| app/program/[id].tsx | Program detail + day list |
| app/program/create.tsx | Create/edit program |
| app/program/pick-template.tsx | Template picker for adding days |

**Modified Files**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| app/(tabs)/index.tsx | Add segmented control (Templates / Programs), "Next Workout" banner (visible on both segments) |
| lib/db.ts | Add 3 tables + CRUD functions for programs, add `program_day_id` column to `workout_sessions`, update `deleteTemplate()` to NULL-ify program_days.template_id, update `startSession()` to accept optional `programDayId` |
| app/session/[id].tsx | After session complete, if `program_day_id` is set, advance program to next day and write program_log entry |

**Implementation Patterns** (from knowledge base):
- Wrap bulk position updates in `withTransactionAsync()` (per "Wrap Bulk SQLite Inserts" learning)
- Use `try/catch/finally` for all async operations with loading state (per "Always Use try/catch/finally" learning)
- Store all data in canonical form (per "Store Measurements in Canonical Units" learning)
- Use `useFocusEffect` for data refresh on list screens (per "useFocusEffect for Data Refresh" learning)
- Program activation: single transaction to deactivate all + activate one
- Day reordering: update positions in a transaction

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Program CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Program day management (add, remove, reorder)
- Active program tracking with auto-advance
- "Next Workout" banner on home screen
- Program detail screen with history
- Soft-delete for programs (consistent with custom exercises)

**Out of Scope:**
- Built-in program templates (PPL, 5/3/1, etc.) — future phase
- Progressive overload automation (auto-increase weight)
- Weekly schedule view (Mon/Tue/Wed mapping)
- Rest day scheduling
- Program sharing/export

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GIVEN no programs exist WHEN user taps Programs segment THEN show empty state with "Create your first program" CTA button
- [ ] GIVEN user is creating a program WHEN they add 3 templates as days THEN days appear in order with position labels
- [ ] GIVEN a program day has an empty label WHEN displayed THEN show the linked template name as fallback
- [ ] GIVEN a program with 3 days WHEN user sets it active THEN any previously active program is deactivated (single transaction)
- [ ] GIVEN an active program on day 2 of 3 WHEN user completes day 2's workout THEN current_day_id advances to the day 3 ID
- [ ] GIVEN an active program on last day WHEN user completes it THEN current_day_id wraps to first day's ID and cycle count increments
- [ ] GIVEN an active program that completes a full cycle WHEN wrapping to day 1 THEN show a brief "Cycle N complete!" snackbar
- [ ] GIVEN an active program WHEN user opens Workouts tab THEN "Next: [Day Label] — [Template Name]" banner appears at top of BOTH segments
- [ ] GIVEN no active program WHEN user opens Workouts tab THEN default to Templates segment (no banner)
- [ ] GIVEN an active program WHEN user opens Workouts tab THEN default to Programs segment
- [ ] GIVEN user taps "Next Workout" banner THEN a session starts from that day's template with `program_day_id` set on the session
- [ ] GIVEN a program WHEN user taps delete THEN confirm dialog and soft-delete (set deleted_at, do not cascade-delete sessions)
- [ ] GIVEN a program with days WHEN user reorders them THEN positions update correctly and current_day_id remains stable
- [ ] GIVEN program detail WHEN user scrolls to history THEN completed sessions for this program are listed newest-first with cycle count
- [ ] GIVEN user adds same template to multiple days (PPL: Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Legs) THEN all 6 days are created correctly
- [ ] Segmented control has accessibilityRole="tab" and accessibilityState={{ selected: true/false }}
- [ ] All new screens have proper accessibilityLabel/accessibilityRole attributes
- [ ] When program advances, announce via accessibilityLiveRegion: "Day N of M complete. Next: [Day Name]"
- [ ] Minimum touch target 48x48dp on all interactive elements
- [ ] "Next Workout" banner has adequate color contrast (theme tokens only)
- [ ] Font sizes >= 12sp for body text, >= 14sp for labels
- [ ] All colors use theme tokens (no hardcoded hex)
- [ ] Program and day lists use FlatList (not ScrollView+map)
- [ ] All database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] PR passes typecheck with zero errors
- [ ] No new lint warnings

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Template deleted while in program | `deleteTemplate()` sets `program_days.template_id = NULL`. Day still shows, name = "Deleted Template". Starting session from that day shows error snackbar "Template no longer exists". |
| Template edited after adding to program | Changes apply immediately — template is by reference. This is expected and documented behavior. |
| Active program with 1 day | current_day_id always points to that day. Completing it wraps to itself and increments cycle count. |
| Two programs both "active" (race) | Enforce single-active in activation function (deactivate all in transaction then activate one) |
| Empty program (0 days) | Cannot set active — show "Add at least one day" error |
| Session cancelled (not completed) | Do NOT advance program day. program_day_id stays on the session row but no program_log entry is written. |
| Very long program name | Truncate with ellipsis in list views (maxWidth constraint) |
| Program deleted during active session | Session completion handler checks if program still exists (not soft-deleted). If deleted, skip auto-advance and do not write program_log. |
| Reorder days of active program | current_day_id stays stable (references day ID, not position). User sees correct "next" workout. |
| Same template in multiple program days | Fully supported — PPL (6 days, 3 templates) is a core use case. Each program_day has its own ID. |
| Duplicate template across programs | Supported — template_id is not unique within program_days. |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Template soft-delete breaks program days | Medium | Medium | LEFT JOIN on template lookup, defensive "Deleted Template" fallback |
| Race condition on program activation | Low | Medium | Single transaction: deactivate all + activate one |
| Large programs (20+ days) slow to reorder | Low | Low | Batch position updates in transaction |

### Dependencies

- Existing workout_templates table + CRUD
- Existing workout_sessions table + session flow
- Soft-delete pattern from Phase 9 (custom exercises)

### Accessibility Requirements

Per knowledge base (quality-pipeline.md): "Embed Accessibility in Every Feature Spec"
- All new touchable elements: accessibilityRole="button", descriptive accessibilityLabel
- Program status announced: accessibilityLabel="Day 2 of 3, next workout: Push Day"
- Reorder controls: accessibilityLabel="Move Push Day up", accessibilityHint="Reorders workout day"
- Empty state: accessibilityRole="text", informative label
- Confirm dialogs: accessibilityLabel on all buttons

### Tech Lead (Technical Feasibility)
**Rev 1 Verdict: NEEDS REVISION** (2 Critical, 2 Major) — _Reviewed 2026-04-13_
**Rev 2 Verdict: APPROVED** ✅ — _Re-reviewed 2026-04-13_

All 4 issues resolved in Rev 2:
1. ✅ `program_day_id` added to `workout_sessions` — clean session-to-program linkage
2. ✅ `deleted_at` added to `programs` schema — soft-delete consistent
3. ✅ FK declarations removed — consistent with codebase
4. ✅ `current_day_id` (TEXT) replaces `current_day` (INTEGER) — reorder-safe

Data model is sound. Implementation path is clear and low-risk. No remaining technical concerns.

### CEO Decision
**Rev 2 addresses all Critical and Major items from both reviews:**

Techlead Critical fixes:
1. ✅ Added `program_day_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL` to `workout_sessions` + `startSession` signature update
2. ✅ Added `deleted_at INTEGER DEFAULT NULL` to `programs` table

Techlead Major fixes:
3. ✅ Removed all FOREIGN KEY declarations (consistent with codebase)
4. ✅ Changed `current_day` (integer) to `current_day_id` (TEXT referencing day ID) — reorder-safe

QD Critical fixes:
1. ✅ Removed FK on template_id, made it nullable, added NULL-ify step in `deleteTemplate()`
2. ✅ Added `deleted_at` to programs table

QD Major fixes:
3. ✅ Specified segmented control defaults (Programs if active program, else Templates)
4. ✅ Specified day label fallback (show template name when empty)
5. ✅ Added cycle completion UX (snackbar + cycle count on detail screen)
6. ✅ Added guard for program deletion during active session

Additional improvements from review recommendations:
- ✅ Segmented control gets accessibilityRole="tab" + accessibilityState
- ✅ Program advance announces via accessibilityLiveRegion
- ✅ FlatList required for program/day lists
- ✅ Parameterized statements required explicitly
- ✅ "Next Workout" banner visible on BOTH segments
- ✅ Same template allowed in multiple days (PPL use case documented)
- ✅ Template edit affects program days documented as expected behavior
