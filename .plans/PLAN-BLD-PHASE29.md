# Feature Plan: Visual Polish & Volta 1 Identity (Phase 29)

**Issue**: BLD-78
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem Statement

Board goal: "User interface is very plain and verbose; leverage more graphics to stand out in the competitive market of workout apps." Additionally: "There's no workout planner app specifically designed for Beyond Power Volta 1 — that device has unique features especially eccentric muscle training."

The home screen is text-heavy with minimal visual distinction between elements. The exercise library shows categories and muscles as plain text chips with no icons. Volta 1 exercises exist in the database (`is_voltra`, `mount_position`, `attachment`, `training_modes`) but have no visual distinction in the exercise list — users can't quickly identify cable-machine exercises.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see my workout streak and weekly stats at a glance on the home screen so I stay motivated
- As a Volta 1 owner, I want to quickly filter exercises compatible with my cable machine so I can build workouts efficiently
- As a user, I want muscle group icons next to exercise categories so I can visually scan the exercise library faster
- As a user, I want visual difficulty indicators so I can gauge exercise complexity at a glance

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

Three focused visual improvements that transform the most-seen screens from text-heavy to graphically rich, using only existing dependencies (MaterialCommunityIcons, React Native Paper):

1. **Home Stats Row** — Compact stat cards at top of home screen
2. **Category & Volta Icons** — Icon mapping for exercise categories + Volta 1 badge
3. **Exercise Card Enhancement** — Difficulty color bar + equipment icon + Volta badge

### UX Design

#### 1. Home Stats Row (above existing banners)

A horizontal row of 3 compact stat cards:

| Stat | Icon | Value | Subtitle |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Streak | `fire` | `4` | "weeks" |
| This Week | `dumbbell` | `3/5` | "workouts" |
| Recent PRs | `trophy` | `2` | "this week" |

Design:
- Cards use `surface` background with `primaryContainer` icon tint
- Fixed height ~72px, equal width (flex: 1), 8px gap between
- Icon (24px) left-aligned, value (titleLarge) center, subtitle (bodySmall) below value
- Entire row scrolls with page (not sticky)
- When no data (streak=0, no sessions): show "0" with muted colors, not hidden

#### 2. Category Icon Map

Add icons to exercise category filter chips and list item category badges:

| Category | Icon Name | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| abs_core | `stomach` | Direct body part |
| arms | `arm-flex` | Bicep curl motion |
| back | `human-handsup` | Lat spread |
| chest | `weight-lifter` | Bench press |
| legs_glutes | `walk` | Leg motion |
| shoulders | `account-arrow-up` | Overhead motion |

Implementation:
- New constant `CATEGORY_ICONS: Record<Category, string>` in `constants/theme.ts`
- Filter chips in exercises.tsx: prepend icon (16px) before label text
- Exercise list item: replace plain category chip with icon + label chip

#### 3. Volta 1 Badge & Filter

**Filter chip**: Add a "Volta 1" filter chip to the exercise list filter bar (after category chips). Icon: `cable-data` (represents cable). When active, filters to `is_voltra = true` exercises only.

**List badge**: Exercises with `is_voltra = true` show a small `cable-data` icon (14px) in the title row, tinted with `tertiary` color. Placed after the exercise name, before the Custom chip.

**Detail screen**: Already shows mount position, attachment, and training modes — no changes needed.

#### 4. Difficulty Color Bar

Add a 3px left border to exercise list items colored by difficulty:

| Difficulty | Color | Existing constant |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| beginner | `semantic.beginner` | Already in theme |
| intermediate | `semantic.intermediate` | Already in theme |
| advanced | `semantic.advanced` | Already in theme |

This provides instant visual scanning of difficulty without reading text.

### Technical Approach

**Files modified** (estimated):
- `constants/theme.ts` — Add `CATEGORY_ICONS` map (~10 lines)
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — Add stats row component above banners (~60 lines)
- `app/(tabs)/exercises.tsx` — Add Volta filter chip, update category chips with icons, add difficulty border, add Volta badge (~40 lines changed)
- No new files, no new dependencies

**Architecture**: All changes are presentational. No data model changes. No new DB queries — all data already fetched (streak, sessions, PRs in index.tsx; is_voltra in exercises.tsx).

**Performance**: Negligible — adding a few icons and a 3px border. Stats row uses data already loaded. No new network calls.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Home screen stats row (streak, weekly workouts, recent PRs)
- Category icons on exercise filter chips and list item category badges
- Volta 1 filter chip and exercise list badge
- Difficulty color bar on exercise list items
- Dark mode compatibility (all changes must work in both themes)

**Out of Scope:**
- Muscle group illustration SVGs (future phase — requires asset creation)
- Exercise detail screen changes (already has Volta info)
- Home screen layout restructuring (just adding stats row on top)
- New DB queries or data model changes
- Animated transitions or micro-interactions
- Template/program card redesign (future phase)
- Navigation or screen flow changes

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given the home screen loads, When the user has workout data, Then a stats row showing streak (with fire icon), weekly workout count, and recent PR count is visible above the banners
- [ ] Given the home screen loads, When streak is 0, Then the streak card shows "0" with muted styling (not hidden)
- [ ] Given the exercise list loads, When viewing filter chips, Then each category chip shows its corresponding Material icon (16px) before the label text
- [ ] Given the exercise list loads, When the user taps the "Volta 1" filter chip, Then only exercises with is_voltra=true are shown
- [ ] Given the exercise list loads, When an exercise has is_voltra=true, Then a cable-data icon (14px, tertiary color) appears in the title row
- [ ] Given the exercise list loads, When viewing any exercise item, Then a 3px left border in the difficulty color (beginner=green, intermediate=yellow, advanced=red) is visible
- [ ] Given dark mode is active, When viewing stats row, filter chips, and exercise cards, Then all icons and colors have adequate contrast (use theme-aware colors only)
- [ ] All existing 268 tests pass with zero regressions
- [ ] npx tsc --noEmit passes with zero type errors
- [ ] No new dependencies added
- [ ] Stats row renders correctly on both phone (375px) and tablet (768px+) widths

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Zero streak (new user) | Stats row shows "0 weeks" with muted icon color |
| No workouts this week | Shows "0/0 workouts" (0 completed / 0 scheduled) or "0" if no schedule |
| No PRs | Shows "0 this week" |
| No Volta exercises in DB | "Volta 1" chip appears but filtering shows empty state |
| Dark mode | All icons use theme-aware colors, no hardcoded colors |
| Tablet layout | Stats cards flex to fill width, maintain proportions |
| Exercise with no difficulty | Default to intermediate color (yellow) |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Icon names incorrect | Low | Low | Verify against MaterialCommunityIcons catalog before implementation |
| Stats row crowds home screen | Low | Medium | Keep compact (72px height max), test with full data |
| Volta filter empty (no Volta exercises) | Medium | Low | Show empty state message, not a crash |
| Difficulty color not visible on colored backgrounds | Low | Medium | Use left border (not background), works on any card background |

## Review Feedback

### Quality Director (UX Critique)

**Verdict: NEEDS REVISION** (2026-04-14)

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Duplicate streak display** — Home screen already has a streak Card (index.tsx L778-793). Plan must specify removing it when adding stats row streak. Two streak indicators = confusing.
2. **Difficulty color bar is color-only** — Violates SKILL [C]: "Color is never the sole indicator of state." Must add secondary channel (text label B/I/A, pattern, or icon) for colorblind users.
3. **Missing a11y labels** — No `accessibilityLabel` specified for stats cards, Volta badge, difficulty bar. Add to acceptance criteria.

#### Major Issues (Should Fix)
4. **`cable-data` icon is misleading** — Depicts an ethernet/LAN cable, not a fitness cable machine. Use a text badge ("V1") or better icon.
5. **"0/0 workouts" empty state** — Looks like a glitch. Show "0 workouts" when no schedule, "0/5" when schedule exists.
6. **Volta filter composition** — Specify whether Volta + category filters = AND (intersection) or OR.

#### Missing Edge Cases
- Exercise with `is_voltra=true` but null difficulty
- Long exercise name + Volta badge + Custom chip = layout overflow on narrow screens
- RTL layout positioning for icons/badges

#### Recommendations
- `human-handsup` (back) and `account-arrow-up` (shoulders) are unintuitive icon choices
- Consider tappable stats cards for navigation
- Document "Volta" (UI) vs "voltra" (DB field) naming inconsistency

### Tech Lead (Technical Feasibility)
**Verdict: NEEDS REVISION** (2026-04-14)

- All icon names verified against MaterialCommunityIcons glyphmap — all exist
- No new dependencies needed; data already loaded in `load()` Promise.all batch
- Architecture fit: compatible, purely presentational, no refactoring needed
- Effort: Small (~110 lines, 4 files), Risk: Low

**MAJOR — Redundant streak & PR display**: Home screen already has a streak card (line 778) and PR card (line 797). Stats row duplicates this data. Plan must clarify: does stats row REPLACE or SUPPLEMENT existing cards? Replacement recommended.

**MINOR — is_voltra filter**: Use strict `=== true` comparison (field is `boolean | undefined`).

**MINOR — 0/0 edge case**: When no workouts scheduled, show "0 workouts" without denominator.

**Must fix before approval**: Clarify streak/PR card replacement strategy.
