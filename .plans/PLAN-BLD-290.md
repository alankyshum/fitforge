# Feature Plan: Nutrition Tab UX Overhaul — Inline Food Search + Keyboard Fix

**Issue**: BLD-290
**GitHub**: #156
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-17
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Owner reported (GitHub #156) two issues with the nutrition experience:

1. **Unnecessary navigation**: The "add food" flow requires navigating to a separate `/nutrition/add` route with tabs (New, Favs, Database, Online). The owner says "we don't need to show 'add food' pane on a nutrition tab when there's only one tab." This suggests the multi-tab add screen feels heavyweight for simple food logging.

2. **Keyboard dismiss bug**: "Every time I type a new word the keyboard dismisses" — when using the online food search, the keyboard loses focus on each keystroke, making it unusable.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Keyboard Dismiss Bug
The `OnlineTab` component in `app/nutrition/add.tsx` has this pattern:
- `query` state drives a `useEffect` debounced search (line 276)
- On every keystroke, `setQuery` triggers the effect which calls `setError(null)`, and if `query.trim().length < 2`, calls `setResults([])` and `setHint(...)` — **multiple state updates per keystroke**
- These state updates cause the parent component tree to re-render
- The `FlashList` receives new `data` (even if empty → empty), which triggers a full list re-render
- **Critically**: The `TextInput` is rendered as `ListHeaderComponent` of the `FlashList` — when FlashList re-renders, it can re-mount the header component, causing the TextInput to lose focus and dismiss the keyboard
- The `header` function (line 466) is defined inline as a **new function reference on every render**, which forces FlashList to re-mount the header component

### UX Issue
The current add-food flow has 4 tabs:
1. **New** — manual entry form (calories, protein, carbs, fat, serving)
2. **Favs** — quick-log from favorites
3. **Database** — search built-in food database (offline, synchronous `searchFoods()`)
4. **Online** — search OpenFoodFacts API (network, debounced)

For phone users, this requires: tap FAB → navigate to `/nutrition/add` → select tab → search → log → auto-navigate back. That's many steps for what should be quick.

The nutrition tab already has an inline form for tablet layouts (`layout.atLeastMedium`), showing a side-by-side view. But phone users must navigate away.

## Proposed Solution

### Part A: Fix Keyboard Dismiss Bug (Quick Fix)
**Root cause**: `header` function in `OnlineTab` and `DatabaseTab` is defined inline, creating new function references on every render, which causes FlashList to re-mount its `ListHeaderComponent`.

**Fix**:
1. Memoize the `header` component with `useMemo` (or extract to a stable component) in both `DatabaseTab` and `OnlineTab`
2. Move `TextInput` out of `FlashList.ListHeaderComponent` — render it above the FlashList instead
3. Wrap the FlashList in a `KeyboardAvoidingView` to ensure proper keyboard interaction

This is a standalone bugfix that can ship immediately, independent of Part B.

### Part B: Inline Food Search on Nutrition Tab (UX Overhaul)
**Goal**: Collapse the `/nutrition/add` route into the nutrition tab itself for phones.

**Approach**: Add a collapsible "Add Food" card to the nutrition tab that expands inline when the FAB is tapped, instead of navigating away.

#### Phase B1: Inline Search Card
1. Replace the FAB navigation with a state toggle (`showAddCard`)
2. When expanded, show a search card below the macro targets with:
   - Search input (searches both local database AND online simultaneously)
   - Meal selector chips
   - Results list (local results first, online results below with a separator)
   - "Manual Entry" button that opens a bottom sheet for custom food entry
3. When collapsed, show just the FAB (current behavior)

#### Phase B2: Remove `/nutrition/add` Route
1. After inline search is working and tested, remove `app/nutrition/add.tsx`
2. Update `app/_layout.tsx` to remove the route registration
3. Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to remove the scan button (move barcode scan to inline card)
4. Keep barcode scanning accessible via an icon button in the search card header

### Important Considerations

#### Tablet Layout
The tablet layout already has an inline add form. The new design should:
- Phone: Show collapsible add card (new behavior)
- Tablet: Keep the side-by-side layout (existing behavior, possibly enhanced with search)

#### State Management
- Search state lives inside the inline card component (not the parent tab)
- Closing the card resets all search state
- Logging food immediately updates the daily log list (no navigation needed)

#### Accessibility
- Search card must trap focus when opened (focusable container)
- Screen reader announces "Add food panel opened/closed"
- All existing accessibility labels preserved
- Minimum touch targets: 48dp

#### Performance
- Local database search: synchronous `useMemo` — no performance concern
- Online search: debounced 400ms — keep existing pattern
- FlashList for results — keep for large result sets
- Lazy render online results (don't search until user switches to online tab or types 2+ chars)

## Files to Modify

### Part A (Keyboard Fix)
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/nutrition/add.tsx` | Move TextInput out of FlashList header; memoize header components |

### Part B (UX Overhaul)
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx` | Add inline search card component, replace FAB behavior |
| `app/nutrition/add.tsx` | **DELETE** after Part B is complete |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | Remove `nutrition/add` route |
| `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` | Remove scan button (line 51) |
| `components/InlineFoodSearch.tsx` | **NEW** — extracted search component for reuse |

### Tests to Add/Update
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `__tests__/flows/nutrition.test.tsx` | Update to test inline add flow |
| `__tests__/acceptance/nutrition.acceptance.test.tsx` | Update acceptance criteria |
| `__tests__/acceptance/food-database.acceptance.test.tsx` | Verify database search still works inline |
| `__tests__/acceptance/online-food-search.acceptance.test.tsx` | Verify online search still works inline |
| `__tests__/acceptance/barcode-scanner.acceptance.test.tsx` | Verify barcode scan accessible from inline card |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Keyboard Fix (BLD-291 — direct fix)
- **Agent**: claudecoder
- **Effort**: Small (1 file, focused fix)
- **Changes**: Extract TextInput from FlashList header, memoize header components
- **Test**: Verify keyboard stays open while typing in search fields

### Phase 2: Inline Food Search (BLD-292 — after plan approval)
- **Agent**: techlead (complex refactor, UX-sensitive)
- **Effort**: Large (multiple files, new component, test updates)
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 merged first (the keyboard fix pattern informs the inline design)
- **Substeps**:
  1. Create `InlineFoodSearch` component extracting search logic from `add.tsx`
  2. Integrate into `nutrition.tsx` as a collapsible card
  3. Update tests
  4. Remove `app/nutrition/add.tsx` and route registrations
  5. Verify tablet layout unaffected

## Acceptance Criteria

### Part A (Keyboard Fix)
- [ ] GIVEN user is on Online food search WHEN typing a search query THEN keyboard stays open for the entire query (does not dismiss between words/characters)
- [ ] GIVEN user is on Database food search WHEN typing a search query THEN keyboard stays open
- [ ] GIVEN user typed a search query WHEN results appear THEN keyboard remains open until user explicitly dismisses or selects a result
- [ ] No new lint warnings
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### Part B (Inline Search)
- [ ] GIVEN user is on nutrition tab (phone) WHEN tapping FAB THEN an inline search card expands below macro targets (no navigation)
- [ ] GIVEN inline search card is open WHEN typing a food name THEN local database results appear immediately AND online results appear after 400ms debounce
- [ ] GIVEN inline search card is open WHEN user taps a food result THEN food is logged to selected meal for current date AND daily log updates immediately
- [ ] GIVEN inline search card is open WHEN user taps "Manual Entry" THEN a bottom sheet opens for custom food entry
- [ ] GIVEN user is on tablet layout WHEN viewing nutrition tab THEN existing side-by-side layout is preserved
- [ ] GIVEN user taps barcode scan icon in inline card WHEN camera opens THEN barcode scanning works as before
- [ ] GIVEN user logs food via inline card WHEN food is logged THEN a Snackbar confirms with undo option
- [ ] `/nutrition/add` route no longer exists
- [ ] All existing nutrition tests pass (adapted for inline flow)
- [ ] No new lint warnings

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| No macro targets set | Search card still works; macro progress section hidden |
| Network offline | Online search shows "offline" message; local database search works fine |
| Empty search results | Show "No foods found" message with suggestion to try different terms |
| Rapid typing | Debounce prevents excessive network requests; local results update instantly |
| Card open + date change | Close the card, show new date's logs |
| Very long food name | Text truncates with ellipsis (numberOfLines={2}) |
| Log food while card open | Food appears in daily log immediately; card stays open for adding more |
| Keyboard overlaps results | KeyboardAvoidingView pushes results up |

## Out of Scope
- Nutrition history page changes
- Macro target editing (stays at `/nutrition/targets`)
- Profile page changes (stays at `/nutrition/profile`)
- Meal planning features
- Food photo recognition
- Nutritional goal recommendations

## Dependencies
- Part B depends on Part A (keyboard fix merged first)
- No external dependencies
- No new packages required
