# Feature Plan: Warm-up Set Tagging (Phase 45)

**Issue**: BLD-266 (PLAN)
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-17
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem Statement

Users currently track warm-up sets alongside working sets with no way to distinguish between them. This causes three concrete problems:

1. **Inflated volume metrics** — warm-up sets at lower weights inflate total volume (weight × reps), making progress tracking inaccurate. A user who does 3 warm-up sets at 60kg before 3 working sets at 100kg sees 780kg total volume instead of the meaningful 300kg working volume.

2. **False personal records** — while warm-up sets are typically lighter (so they don't trigger weight PRs), they _can_ trigger false rep PRs or volume PRs if a user does high-rep warm-ups.

3. **Misleading muscle volume counts** — the MuscleVolumeSegment counts all completed sets, including warm-ups, which overstates training stimulus for muscle groups.

Serious lifters universally track warm-up and working sets separately. This is a standard feature in Strong, JEFIT, HEVY, and every major fitness app.

## User Stories

- As a lifter, I want to mark a set as warm-up so that my volume and PR stats only reflect working sets
- As a lifter reviewing history, I want to see which sets were warm-ups vs working sets so I can understand my workout structure
- As a lifter, I want warm-up sets to be visually distinct during my workout so I can quickly see where I am in my session

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

Add an `is_warmup` boolean column to `workout_sets`. Users toggle a set between warm-up and working via a single tap on a new "W" badge in the set row. Warm-up sets are visually dimmed and excluded from volume/PR calculations.

### UX Design

#### Session Screen (app/session/[id].tsx)

**Set Row Changes:**
- Add a small circular badge/chip to the left of the set number showing "W" for warm-up sets
- Tap the badge to toggle warm-up status (works on both completed and uncompleted sets)
- Warm-up sets have reduced opacity (0.6) on the entire row
- The set number label changes from "1" to "W1" for warm-up sets (warm-up sets numbered independently: W1, W2, W3...)
- Actually, simpler approach: keep sequential numbering but show a small "warm-up" chip below the set number

**Simpler UX approach (recommended):**
- Each set row gets a small toggleable chip/icon to the left of the weight input
- Icon: `dumbbell` (filled) for working sets, `dumbbell` (outlined/dimmed) for warm-up sets
- Actually even simpler: a small "W" circular badge that appears when tapped, similar to how RPE works
- Long-press on the set number to toggle warm-up status
- Warm-up sets: row background gets a subtle left-border accent (2dp) in `surfaceVariant` color
- Set number shows in lighter color for warm-ups

**Recommended approach — Toggle via set number tap:**
- Tap the set number text (1, 2, 3...) to cycle: working → warm-up → working
- When warm-up: set number shows as "W" in a faded style + left border accent
- This is zero additional UI footprint — reuses existing set number space
- accessibilityLabel: "Set N, warm-up" or "Set N, working set"
- accessibilityHint: "Tap to toggle warm-up"

#### Session Summary (app/session/summary/[id].tsx)

- Show "X warm-up sets, Y working sets" in the stats card
- Only working sets contribute to the volume displayed

#### Session Detail / History (app/session/detail/[id].tsx)

- Warm-up sets shown with "W" prefix and dimmed styling (same as session screen)
- Repeat Workout: warm-up tags are carried over to the new session

#### Template Screen — OUT OF SCOPE for Phase 45

Template-level warm-up set configuration (e.g., "2 warm-up sets + 3 working sets") is explicitly deferred to a future phase. Phase 45 focuses on session-level tagging only.

### Technical Approach

#### 1. Schema Migration (lib/db/helpers.ts)

Add column to `workout_sets`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE workout_sets ADD COLUMN is_warmup INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

Pattern: follows existing migration style (check `PRAGMA table_info`, add if missing).

#### 2. Type Update (lib/types.ts)

Add to `WorkoutSet`:
```typescript
is_warmup: boolean;
```

#### 3. DB Layer (lib/db/sessions.ts)

**New function:**
```typescript
export async function updateSetWarmup(id: string, isWarmup: boolean): Promise<void>
```

**Modified functions — read `is_warmup` column:**
- `getSessionSets()` — include `is_warmup` in SELECT
- `addSet()` — accept optional `isWarmup` parameter, default false
- `addSetsBatch()` — accept optional `isWarmup` in batch items

**Modified queries — exclude warm-ups from metrics:**
All queries that calculate volume, PRs, or muscle volume need `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` added:

| Function | File | Change |
|----------|------|--------|
| `getPersonalRecords()` | sessions.ts:498 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getSessionPRs()` | sessions.ts:555 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getRecentPRs()` | sessions.ts:590 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getWeeklyVolume()` | sessions.ts:477 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getExerciseChartData()` | sessions.ts (chart) | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getExercise1RMChartData()` | sessions.ts (1RM chart) | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getMuscleVolumeForWeek()` | sessions.ts:861 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getMuscleVolumeTrend()` | sessions.ts:914 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getWeeklySummary()` volume query | weekly-summary.ts:96 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getWeeklyPRs()` | weekly-summary.ts:150 | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getSessionComparison()` | sessions.ts | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getSessionWeightIncreases()` | sessions.ts | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getSessionRepPRs()` | sessions.ts | Add `AND ws.is_warmup = 0` |
| `getPreviousSets()` | sessions.ts | Do NOT filter — show all sets for reference |

**Important: `getSessionSetCount()` and `getSessionAvgRPE()` should ALSO exclude warm-ups** so that home screen set counts and RPE averages reflect working sets only.

**Important: `getSessionSets()` should NOT filter warm-ups** — it returns all sets for display.

#### 4. Session UI (app/session/[id].tsx)

**SetRow component changes:**
- Accept `isWarmup` prop
- Tap on set number toggles warm-up status
- Call new `onToggleWarmup(setId)` callback
- Visual: warm-up rows get left border accent + dimmed set number showing "W"

**Session screen changes:**
- Add `handleToggleWarmup` callback that calls `updateSetWarmup()` and updates local state
- Pass through to SetRow

#### 5. Session Summary (app/session/summary/[id].tsx)

- Query or derive warm-up vs working set counts from `sets` data
- Display "N warm-up + M working sets" in stats

#### 6. Session Detail (app/session/detail/[id].tsx)

- Read `is_warmup` from set data
- Apply same visual treatment as session screen

#### 7. Repeat Workout (app/session/[id].tsx — sourceSessionId branch)

- When populating from source session, carry over `is_warmup` flag to new sets

#### 8. Import/Export (lib/db/import-export.ts)

- Add `is_warmup` to workout_sets export columns
- Handle missing `is_warmup` on import (default to 0)
- Bump export format version if needed (check current version)

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- `is_warmup` column on `workout_sets`
- Toggle warm-up status per set in active session
- Visual distinction for warm-up sets (session, detail, summary screens)
- Exclude warm-ups from all volume and PR calculations
- Carry warm-up tags when repeating a workout
- Include in import/export

**Out of Scope:**
- Template-level warm-up configuration (future phase)
- Auto-detection of warm-up sets based on weight progression
- Warm-up set suggestions/recommendations
- Separate warm-up timer durations
- Drop set or failure set tagging (separate feature)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given an active session, When user taps a set number, Then the set toggles between warm-up and working state
- [ ] Given a warm-up set, Then it displays with "W" label and dimmed/accented visual styling
- [ ] Given a warm-up set is completed, Then it is excluded from the session's total volume calculation
- [ ] Given a warm-up set on an exercise, Then it does NOT trigger a personal record for that exercise
- [ ] Given a completed session with warm-up sets, Then the summary shows "N warm-up + M working sets"
- [ ] Given a completed session with warm-ups in history, Then the detail view shows warm-up styling
- [ ] Given a session being repeated (Repeat Workout), Then warm-up tags from the source are preserved
- [ ] Given weekly volume calculations, Then warm-up sets are excluded from volume totals
- [ ] Given muscle volume calculations, Then warm-up sets are excluded from set counts
- [ ] Given a data export, Then `is_warmup` column is included in the backup
- [ ] Given a data import without `is_warmup` column, Then all sets default to working (is_warmup = 0)
- [ ] The warm-up toggle has accessibilityLabel "Warm-up set" / "Working set" and accessibilityHint "Tap to toggle"
- [ ] PR passes all existing tests with no regressions
- [ ] No new lint warnings

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Toggle warm-up on already-completed set | Allowed — user may realize after completing that it was a warm-up |
| All sets marked as warm-up | Session volume shows 0, no PRs triggered. Valid scenario (user abandoned working sets) |
| Warm-up set with RPE | Allowed — RPE on warm-ups is valid data |
| Warm-up set with notes | Allowed — notes on warm-ups are preserved |
| Superset with mixed warm-up/working | Each set toggles independently within the superset |
| Toggle warm-up during rest timer | Allowed — does not interfere with rest timer |
| Session with only warm-up sets completed | Summary shows "N warm-up + 0 working sets", volume = 0 |
| Export v3 → import on older app | `is_warmup` column silently ignored by older versions |
| Import old backup without is_warmup | All sets default to working (is_warmup = 0) |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Accidental warm-up toggle | Medium | Low | Toggle is on set number (small target), visual feedback is immediate, easy to undo |
| Volume stats change after upgrade | Low | Medium | Existing sets default to `is_warmup = 0` — no historical data changes |
| Query performance with new filter | Very Low | Low | `is_warmup` is a simple integer filter on existing indexed queries |
| Breaking import/export compatibility | Low | Medium | Handle missing column gracefully, don't require it |

### Existing Code Inventory

Files that will be modified:
- `lib/db/helpers.ts` — schema migration (add column)
- `lib/types.ts` — WorkoutSet type update
- `lib/db/sessions.ts` — CRUD functions, metric queries (~15 queries)
- `lib/db/weekly-summary.ts` — volume + PR queries (~3 queries)
- `lib/db/import-export.ts` — export/import column handling
- `app/session/[id].tsx` — SetRow visual, toggle handler, repeat workout
- `app/session/summary/[id].tsx` — warm-up/working breakdown display
- `app/session/detail/[id].tsx` — warm-up visual in history
- `lib/db/index.ts` — export new function

Files that should NOT be modified:
- `app/template/[id].tsx` — template warm-up config is out of scope
- `app/tools/*` — no impact on tools
- `lib/achievements.ts` — achievements count completed sets regardless of warm-up status (this is intentional: completing warm-ups still counts toward "Complete N sets" achievements)
- `components/MuscleVolumeSegment.tsx` — no changes needed (it calls getMuscleVolumeForWeek which will be filtered)
