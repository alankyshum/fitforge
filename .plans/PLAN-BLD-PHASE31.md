# Feature Plan: Plate Calculator

**Issue**: BLD-83
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem Statement

Gym-goers constantly need to calculate which plates to load on a barbell. After using the 1RM calculator to find their target percentage, users have to mentally figure out the plate combination — a tedious, error-prone process, especially mid-workout. Every serious fitness app includes a plate calculator. FitForge currently has a 1RM calculator (`app/tools/rm.tsx`) but no way to translate those numbers into actual plates on a bar. This gap forces users out of the app and into mental math or a competing tool.

## User Stories

- As a gym-goer, I want to enter a target weight and instantly see which plates to load on each side of the barbell, so I don't waste time counting plates between sets
- As a lifter using the 1RM calculator, I want to tap a weight in the percentage table and see the plate breakdown, so I can seamlessly go from planning to loading
- As a home gym owner with a non-standard plate collection, I want to customize my available plates, so the calculator shows combinations I can actually achieve

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

Add a Plate Calculator screen at `app/tools/plate.tsx` alongside the existing 1RM calculator. The screen accepts a target weight, subtracts the bar weight, and shows the optimal plate combination per side using a greedy algorithm (largest plates first). Includes a visual barbell diagram with color-coded plates. Users can customize bar weight and available plate inventory. Integrates with the 1RM percentage table via deep linking.

### UX Design

**Screen Layout (top to bottom):**
1. **Target weight input** — numeric TextInput with unit suffix (kg/lb)
2. **Bar weight selector** — segmented buttons for common bars (20kg/45lb standard, 15kg/35lb women's, 10kg/25lb EZ curl, or custom)
3. **Per-side weight** — calculated label: "(target - bar) / 2 = X per side"
4. **Barbell diagram** — horizontal visual: bar center → plates from inside out, color-coded by weight, mirrored on both sides
5. **Plate list** — explicit list of plates per side (e.g., "1× 20kg, 1× 10kg, 1× 2.5kg")
6. **Total confirmation** — "Total: 85kg (bar 20kg + 2×32.5kg)"

**Color-coded plates (standard gym colors — IWF/IPF spec):**
| Weight (kg) | Weight (lb) | Color |
|------------|------------|-------|
| 25 | 55 | Red |
| 20 | 45 | Blue |
| 15 | 35 | Yellow |
| 10 | 25 | Green |
| 5 | 10 | White |
| 2.5 | 5 | Black |
| 1.25 | 2.5 | Chrome/Silver |
| 0.5 | 1 | Gray (thin) |

**Plate diagram rendering:**
- Use a horizontal `View` with colored rectangles of varying height (heavier = taller)
- Bar rendered as a thin gray rectangle in the center
- Plates stacked from inside (near bar) to outside (near collar)
- Mirror both sides for symmetry
- Aspect ratios match real plate proportions roughly

**Navigation:**
- Accessible from the tools section (add a "Plate Calculator" card to the exercises tab tools area, or add a tools tab)
- Currently tools are accessed via direct navigation. Add `app/tools/plate.tsx` and register the route.
- Deep link from 1RM calculator: tapping a row in the percentage table navigates to the plate calculator with that weight pre-filled

**Edge states:**
- Weight ≤ bar weight → show "Weight must exceed bar weight" message
- Unachievable exact weight (not divisible by smallest plate) → round to nearest achievable, show "Rounded to X (nearest achievable)"
- No plates available → show "Add plates in settings"
- Target = 0 → show empty bar diagram

### Technical Approach

**New files:**
1. `app/tools/plate.tsx` — Plate Calculator screen (~200-250 lines)
2. `lib/plates.ts` — Pure logic: greedy algorithm, standard plate sets, types (~80 lines)
3. `__tests__/lib/plates.test.ts` — Unit tests for plate calculation logic

**Algorithm (greedy, per side):**
```typescript
function solve(target: number, available: number[]): { plates: number[], remainder: number } {
  // target = weight per side = (totalWeight - barWeight) / 2
  // available = sorted descending list of plate weights (with duplicates for quantity)
  // Greedy: pick largest plate that fits, repeat
  const plates: number[] = []
  let remaining = target
  for (const plate of available) {
    while (remaining >= plate) {
      plates.push(plate)
      remaining -= plate
      remaining = Math.round(remaining * 1000) / 1000 // float precision
    }
  }
  return { plates, remainder: remaining }
}
```

**Standard plate sets (defaults):**
- **Metric (kg):** 2× each of [25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.5]
- **Imperial (lb):** 2× each of [55, 45, 35, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1]

**Plate inventory customization (Phase 32 — OUT OF SCOPE):**
Custom plate inventory editing is deferred. Phase 31 uses the standard plate sets above. Users who need custom plates can use mental math for now. If demand is clear, Phase 32 adds a plate inventory editor in settings.

**Bar weight defaults by unit:**
- kg: 20 (standard Olympic), 15, 10, or custom
- lb: 45 (standard Olympic), 35, 25, or custom

**Integration with 1RM calculator:**
- In `app/tools/rm.tsx`, each row in the percentage table gets a plate icon button
- Tapping it navigates to `/tools/plate?weight=X&unit=kg` with the weight pre-filled
- The plate calculator reads these query params on mount via `useLocalSearchParams`

**No DB changes needed** — no persistent state. Bar weight preference could be stored in body_settings later, but for Phase 31 it defaults to 20kg/45lb and resets on screen unmount. This keeps scope tight.

**Accessibility:**
- Plate diagram: `accessibilityLabel="Barbell loaded with [list of plates] on each side, total [weight]"`
- Individual plate visuals are decorative — the plate list below provides text alternative
- All inputs have proper `accessibilityLabel` attributes
- Color coding paired with weight labels (not color-only distinction) per WCAG

**Performance:**
- Algorithm is O(n) per plate set — trivial performance
- No DB queries (pure calculation)
- Re-renders only on input change

### Scope

- Collar weight consideration

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a target weight of 100kg and a 20kg bar, When the user opens the plate calculator, Then it shows 1×20kg + 1×15kg + 1×5kg per side (40kg per side)
- [ ] Given a target weight of 135lb and a 45lb bar, When the user opens the plate calculator, Then it shows 1×45lb per side
- [ ] Given a target weight of 67.5kg and a 20kg bar, When the user opens the plate calculator, Then it shows the nearest achievable combination with a "Rounded" notice if exact match is impossible
- [ ] Given the user taps a row in the 1RM percentage table, When the plate calculator opens, Then the weight is pre-filled from the selected percentage
- [ ] Given a target weight less than or equal to the bar weight, When the user enters it, Then a message says "Weight must exceed bar weight"
- [ ] Given the plate calculator is open, When the user views the barbell diagram, Then plates are color-coded by weight using standard competition colors
- [ ] Given a screen reader is active, When the user views the plate calculator, Then the barbell diagram has a descriptive accessibility label listing all plates and total weight
- [ ] All existing 310+ tests pass with no regressions
- [ ] New unit tests cover the plate calculation algorithm (at least 8 test cases)
- [ ] No new lint warnings

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Target weight = 0 | Show empty bar only |
| Target weight < bar weight | Show "Weight must exceed bar weight" |
| Target weight = bar weight | Show empty bar (0 plates per side) |
| Odd remainder after dividing by 2 | Round per-side to nearest 0.5kg/1lb, show rounded notice |
| Weight not achievable with available plates | Show closest achievable weight, display "Rounded to X" |
| Very large weight (e.g., 500kg) | Algorithm handles gracefully — show many plates |
| Decimal input (e.g., 72.5) | Accept and calculate correctly |
| Negative input | Treat as invalid — show error |
| Non-numeric input | Ignore invalid characters (numeric keyboard) |
| Switching bar weight | Recalculate immediately |
| Deep link with pre-filled weight | Weight appears in input, calculation runs automatically |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Floating point rounding errors | Medium | Low | Round to 3 decimal places after each subtraction |
| Plate colors not accessible | Low | Medium | Always pair color with weight label text |
| Navigation registration | Low | Low | Follow existing pattern from rm.tsx |
| 1RM integration breaks existing screen | Low | Medium | Only add an icon button per row, no structural changes |
