# Feature Plan: Barbell Plate Calculator (Phase 17)

**Issue**: TBD
**Author**: CEO
**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem Statement

When loading a barbell, lifters must mentally calculate which plates to put on each side. For example, a target of 102.5kg requires: (102.5 - 20) / 2 = 41.25kg per side → 20 + 15 + 5 + 1.25. This mental math is error-prone — especially when fatigued mid-workout, switching between metric and imperial, or using unfamiliar plate inventory at a new gym.

Every serious gym app (Strong, Hevy, JEFIT) includes a plate calculator. FitForge currently has no such utility. Users must do the math on paper or in their head, which slows down workouts and risks loading errors.

## User Stories

- As a lifter, I want to enter a target barbell weight and instantly see which plates to load on each side
- As a lifter at an unfamiliar gym, I want to specify which plate sizes are available so the calculator works with whatever's on the rack
- As a lifter, I want the calculator to use my preferred unit (kg or lb) automatically
- As a lifter mid-workout, I want quick access to the plate calculator without leaving my session

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

A single new screen (`app/tools/plates.tsx`) that calculates barbell plate loading. Accessible from the Workouts tab via a toolbar icon and from the active session screen via a toolbar action. Uses the user's weight unit preference from body_settings. No schema changes, no new dependencies.

### UX Design

#### Screen Layout

1. **Bar Weight Selector** — segmented buttons for common bar weights:
   - kg: 20 (standard), 15 (women's), 10 (training)
   - lb: 45, 35, 25
   - Bar weight respects user's unit preference

2. **Target Weight Input** — large, prominent TextInput for total target weight
   - Shows unit label (kg/lb)
   - Step buttons (±2.5kg or ±5lb) — reuse pattern from Phase 16
   - Auto-focuses on screen load

3. **Plate Breakdown Display** — visual representation:
   - "Per side: X kg/lb" header
   - List of plates with count and size: "2 × 20kg, 1 × 5kg, 1 × 2.5kg"
   - Color-coded plate badges matching standard competition colors:
     - 25kg/55lb = red, 20kg/45lb = blue, 15kg/35lb = yellow, 10kg/25lb = green
     - 5kg/10lb = white, 2.5kg/5lb = black/dark, 1.25kg/2.5lb = silver
   - Use theme-compatible color tokens (not hardcoded hex)
   - Simple barbell visualization (horizontal bar with colored plate rectangles)

4. **Available Plates Configuration** — expandable section:
   - Default plate inventory: [25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25] kg or [55, 45, 35, 25, 10, 5, 2.5] lb
   - Each plate size shows a toggle (on/off) and count selector (1-10 per side)
   - Defaults: 10 of each plate (unlimited for practical purposes)
   - User can disable plate sizes not available at their gym

5. **Error/Edge States:**
   - Target weight less than bar weight → "Target must be greater than bar weight ({barWeight}kg)"
   - Impossible weight (can't make with available plates) → "Cannot make {X}kg with available plates. Closest: {Y}kg"
   - Odd weight (not divisible into plates) → show closest achievable weight

#### Navigation

- **From Workouts tab**: toolbar IconButton (calculator icon) in the header
- **From active session**: toolbar IconButton in the session header
- **Stack screen** (not a tab) — `app/tools/plates.tsx`

### Technical Approach

#### Plate Calculation Algorithm

Greedy approach (works for standard plate sets):
```
function calculatePlates(target, barWeight, availablePlates):
  perSide = (target - barWeight) / 2
  if perSide < 0: return error "Target less than bar"
  
  result = []
  remaining = perSide
  for plate in availablePlates (sorted descending):
    while remaining >= plate.weight and plate.remaining > 0:
      result.push(plate.weight)
      remaining -= plate.weight
      plate.remaining -= 1
  
  if remaining > 0.001: return error "Cannot make exact weight"
  return result
```

#### State Management

- Target weight: local state (TextInput)
- Bar weight: local state (segmented buttons)
- Available plates: local state with defaults based on unit
- Unit: fetched from `getBodySettings()` on mount
- No persistence needed — plate calculator is ephemeral

#### File Structure

- `app/tools/plates.tsx` — main plate calculator screen
- No new lib files needed (algorithm is simple, lives in the component)
- No schema changes
- No new dependencies

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Plate calculator screen with target input, bar selection, plate breakdown
- Simple barbell visualization with colored plates
- Available plates configuration (toggle/count per size)
- Default plate inventories for kg and lb
- Navigation from Workouts tab and active session
- Weight unit from body_settings
- Step buttons on target weight input (reuse Phase 16 pattern)
- Error handling for impossible/invalid weights

**Out of Scope:**
- Persisting plate configuration (advanced — future phase if needed)
- Warm-up set calculator (separate feature)
- 1RM calculator (separate feature)
- Barbell type database (Olympic, hex bar, etc.)
- Custom plate sizes beyond standard sets
- Sound effects or animations beyond basic color coding

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a user opens the plate calculator When they enter 100 and bar=20kg Then display shows "Per side: 40kg → 1×20kg, 1×15kg, 1×5kg"
- [ ] Given a user with lb preference When they enter 135 and bar=45lb Then display shows "Per side: 45lb → 1×45lb"
- [ ] Given a user enters 25 with bar=20kg Then display shows "Per side: 2.5kg → 1×2.5kg"
- [ ] Given a user enters 15 with bar=20kg Then display shows error "Target must be greater than bar weight (20kg)"
- [ ] Given a user disables 2.5kg plates and enters 102.5 with bar=20kg Then display shows "Cannot make 41.25kg with available plates. Closest: 40kg"
- [ ] Given the user taps the plus step button Then target weight increases by 2.5kg (or 5lb)
- [ ] Given a user accesses from the Workouts tab Then the calculator opens with their unit preference
- [ ] Given a user accesses from an active session Then the calculator opens and back returns to the session
- [ ] Plate badges use theme-compatible colors (no hardcoded hex)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles with zero errors (`bun typecheck`)
- [ ] App starts without crashes
- [ ] Existing workout flows work unchanged

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Target = bar weight | "Per side: 0kg — no plates needed" (valid, show empty barbell) |
| Target < bar weight | Error message, no plate breakdown |
| Target = 0 | Error message |
| Very heavy weight (500kg) | Calculate normally — greedy algo handles any value |
| Fractional weight that can't be made | Show closest achievable weight and the difference |
| All plates disabled | "No plates available" message |
| User switches unit in Settings | Calculator reflects change on next open (reads body_settings) |
| Step button from empty field | Starts from bar weight + step |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Greedy algorithm fails for exotic plate sets | Very Low | Low | Standard plate sets are always greedy-solvable. Edge case for non-standard sets shows "closest" fallback. |
| Too many plate sizes crowd the UI | Low | Medium | Default to collapsed "Available Plates" section. Most users won't need to change defaults. |
| Colors for plate badges don't work in dark mode | Medium | Medium | Use theme-compatible color definitions with adequate contrast for both modes. |

### Accessibility

- Target weight TextInput: `accessibilityLabel="Target barbell weight"`
- Bar weight buttons: `accessibilityLabel="Bar weight {N} kilograms/pounds"`
- Step buttons: reuse Phase 16 pattern with `accessibilityLabel="Increase/Decrease target weight by {step}"`
- Plate breakdown: `accessibilityLabel="{count} times {weight} kilogram/pound plate"` on each plate badge
- Color-coded plates: colors are supplementary — plate weight is always displayed as text
- Available plate toggles: `accessibilityLabel="Toggle {weight} kilogram/pound plates"`
